# Unity Error Fixer - Quick Solution Guide

## Problem Summary
You're experiencing "The referenced script (Unknown) on this Behaviour is missing!" errors and "AnimateText reference is missing" issues in your Unity project.

## Quick Fix Solution

### Step 1: Add the Error Fixer to Your Scene
1. In Unity, go to your `MainGameplay` scene
2. Create an empty GameObject (Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty)
3. Name it "ErrorFixer"
4. Add the `UnityErrorFixer` script to this GameObject

### Step 2: Run the Fixes
With the ErrorFixer GameObject selected:

1. **Right-click on the UnityErrorFixer component** in the Inspector
2. Choose **"Fix All Common Issues"** from the context menu

This will automatically:
- Remove all missing script references
- Fix the NarrativeManager's AnimateText component
- Set up the CSV file if missing

### Alternative: Individual Fixes
If you prefer to fix issues one by one:

- **"Diagnose Scene Issues"** - Shows what problems exist
- **"Fix All Missing Script References"** - Removes broken script links
- **"Fix NarrativeManager AnimateText Reference"** - Fixes the AnimateText component

## What This Fixes

✅ **Missing Script References**: Removes broken component links that show as "(Unknown)"

✅ **NarrativeManager Issues**: 
- Adds missing AnimateText component
- Links it properly to NarrativeManager
- Sets up CSV file if missing

✅ **Console Errors**: Should eliminate the error messages you're seeing

## After Running the Fix

1. **Save your scene** (Ctrl+S)
2. **Play the scene** to test
3. Check the Console - errors should be gone
4. Your narrative text should now display properly

## If Issues Persist

1. Make sure the **BitWave Labs AnimatedTextReveal** package is properly imported
2. Check that you have a **TemplateNarrativeTexts.csv** file in your Resources folder
3. Run **"Diagnose Scene Issues"** to see what specific problems remain
