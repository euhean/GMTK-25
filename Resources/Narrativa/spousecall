Hey Alex. /n
I hope you reconsider coming this weekend to my grandma's,/n
the kids sure would love to be with you, and I think you need a bit of time away from *Bloom*./n
I know you're used to long days, but at least when we were back home,/n
we spent time outside , there were other people too./n
Do you know how long it's been since I've talked to somebody about /n
anything else than their work? /n
I already told you when we got here, the place gives me the jeebies /n
